## Green's Discs Series

Green's Discs is a series of music discs sets that I wanted to be able to listen to on minecraft with my friends. I originally planned that the songs would be a in single mod but decided to turn it more modular.

I don't know how to program in mods using things from other mods so as such music discs are only obtainable in creative. If I ever do learn there will be a core mod and discs will become obtainable in survival.
