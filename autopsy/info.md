## Mods Not Included That Were Requested

### Origins

Origins is a fabric mod which is incompatible with forge mod loader

### Witchery

Witchery was only made for 1.7.10 only there is a spiritual succesor called bewitchment but we decided against it as it is similar but not the same.

### Optifine

With Optifine I was unsure wether it would cause weird imcompatibilities (Main reason) and its against optifines policy to redistrubite it so if you want you can add it to the mods files manually.
